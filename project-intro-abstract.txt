Abstract
Optimizing transportation networks, such as railway systems, requires a multifaceted approach due to various influencing factors. This study aims to develop a framework for determining optimal routes within a transportation network by integrating several critical criteria: distance, cost, strategic importance, population density, economic wealth, and tourism potential. The goal is to compute a composite weight for each potential route using these factors, which then guides the selection of the most efficient paths. Three graph-based algorithms—Dijkstra's Algorithm, A* Algorithm, and Bellman-Ford Algorithm—are utilized to evaluate and compare their effectiveness in finding optimal routes. This study also includes a visual representation of the network to facilitate a deeper understanding of how each algorithm performs under different conditions. The findings provide insights into selecting the best routes that balance multiple objectives, offering a practical approach to network optimization problems.

Introduction
Background:

Transportation networks, such as railways, are crucial for efficient logistics, economic development, and regional connectivity. Optimizing these networks involves more than just considering the shortest physical distance between nodes. Various factors must be integrated to evaluate routes comprehensively. These factors include:

Distance: Physical travel distance between nodes.
Cost: Financial expenditure associated with constructing or maintaining the route.
Strategic Importance: The significance of each node from a strategic perspective.
Population Density: The number of people who will benefit from the route.
Economic Wealth: The economic impact or benefit of connecting nodes with varying economic statuses.
Tourism Potential: The significance of nodes as tourist destinations.
Problem Statement:

The challenge is to identify optimal routes in a transportation network by integrating multiple criteria into a composite weight for each route. This problem can be modeled as a graph where nodes represent locations and edges represent potential routes with associated weights derived from the criteria listed above
