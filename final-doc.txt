### Abstract

Optimizing transportation networks, such as railway systems, involves considering multiple factors to determine the best routes. This study aims to create a comprehensive framework for finding optimal routes by integrating several important criteria: distance,  population density, economic wealth, and tourism potential. To achieve this, we will calculate a composite weight for each potential route, which helps in selecting the most efficient paths. The study employs three key graph algorithms—Dijkstra’s Algorithm, A* Algorithm, and Bellman-Ford Algorithm—to analyze and compare their effectiveness in route optimization.

Dijkstra’s Algorithm is used for finding the shortest path in a graph with non-negative weights. A* Algorithm improves performance by using a heuristic to estimate the cost to the goal, enhancing search efficiency. Bellman-Ford Algorithm is employed to handle graphs with negative weight edges and detect any negative weight cycles.  The findings will provide valuable insights into selecting the most suitable routes that balance different objectives, offering practical solutions for optimizing transportation networks.

### Introduction

**Background:**

Transportation networks, like railways, are essential for smooth logistics, economic growth, and regional connectivity. Optimizing these networks involves more than just finding the shortest path between locations. A variety of factors must be considered to evaluate the best routes comprehensively. These factors include:

- **Distance:** The physical length of the route between two points.
- **Cost:** The financial investment required for building or maintaining the route.
- **Strategic Importance:** The value of a location based on its strategic role in security, trade, or other important aspects.
- **Population Density:** The number of people living in an area, reflecting how many will benefit from the route.
- **Economic Wealth:** The economic benefit or impact of connecting wealthier or economically significant locations.
- **Tourism Potential:** The importance of a location as a tourist destination.

**Problem Statement:**

The challenge is to identify the optimal routes within a transportation network by combining multiple criteria into a single composite weight for each route. This involves creating a model where locations (nodes) and routes (edges) are analyzed based on various factors. The goal is to use this model to find the most efficient paths that balance these different criteria.

### Methodology

**1. Define the Graph Data:**

- **Nodes:** Represent various locations or cities in the network.
- **Edges:** Represent the possible routes between locations, with weights assigned based on distance, cost, and other factors.

**2. Implement Algorithms:**

1. **Dijkstra’s Algorithm:**
   - **Description:** Finds the shortest path from a starting node to all other nodes in a graph with non-negative weights.
   - **Example:** In a graph with nodes A, B, C, and D, if we want to find the shortest path from A to D, Dijkstra’s Algorithm will explore paths starting from A, updating distances to each node until the shortest path to D is found.

2. **A* Algorithm:**
   - **Description:** Enhances pathfinding by combining the actual cost to reach a node with an estimated cost (heuristic) to reach the goal.
   - **Heuristic Function:** Provides an estimate of the remaining cost to the goal. It must be admissible (not overestimating) and consistent (the estimated cost should be less than or equal to the cost from the current node plus the cost to a neighboring node).
   - **Example:** If the heuristic from node A to the goal D is 10 km, and the cost from A to a neighboring node C is 8 km, A* will prioritize paths that combine these costs to find the most efficient route.

3. **Bellman-Ford Algorithm:**
   - **Description:** Finds the shortest paths from a starting node to all other nodes, even if some edges have negative weights, and detects negative weight cycles.
   - **Example:** In a graph with nodes and edges that include negative weights, Bellman-Ford Algorithm iteratively updates distances to ensure that the shortest path is found and checks for cycles where the path cost can be reduced indefinitely.


### Schedule

1. **Define Graph Data:**
   - Identify nodes and edges, and assign weights based on various factors.

1. **Merging Different Factors :**
   - Merging Different Weights/Factors Into A Single Value/weight For Calculation Based On Certain Criteria.

2. **Implement Algorithms:**
   - Develop code for Dijkstra’s Algorithm, A* Algorithm, and Bellman-Ford Algorithm.
   - Test each algorithm to ensure correct functionality.

3. **Visualize Results:**
   - Create visual representations of the network and the routes found by each algorithm.
   - Use different layers to show how each factor influences route selection.


### Conclusion

This project explores Dijkstra’s, A*, and Bellman-Ford algorithms for optimizing transportation networks. By evaluating and comparing these algorithms, we aim to find the most effective method for different types of networks and criteria. The visualizations and analysis will help in understanding how each algorithm performs and guide the selection of optimal routes.
